<h2 align="center"> ✨ Spam Filtering in Python  ✨ </h2>

> Starting out in Intrusion Detection System. With love ❤️

<hr>

### _ Introduction _

```python
# implemented using scikit-learn library
# pip install scikit-learn
# python **/spam_filter.py
# use jupyter notebook too! (that .ipynb file)
```

    Inside spam_emails_data, we have spams and hams, that are supposed to train the system.
    The returned results seem good.

**Note** -- Does this not require some frontend for good implementation? Sure does. Working on our Django App!
