> Starting out in Intrusion Detection System. With love ❤️

<hr>

### _ Introduction _

```python
# implemented using scikit-learn library
# pip install scikit-learn
# python **/spam_filter.py
```


    Inside spam_emails_data, we have spams and hams, that are supposed to train the system.
    The data returned seems really fine.

**Note** -- Does this not require some frontend for good implementation? Sure does. Working on it!
